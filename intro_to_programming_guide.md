[![Why Learn Programming](http://img.youtube.com/vi/nKIu9yen5nc/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc)

Feel free to skip to the curriculum section if you ready to learn programming. But read on if you need some convincing on why programming can be [a game changer] for your life. 

Programming is becoming more important in our lives as technology, from  smart phones to self-driving cars,  is becoming more embedded in our lives. Even people from the likes of President Obama and NYC Mayer Bloomberg to basketball star Chris Bosh encouraging everyone one of us to learn programming. [links here]

Specifically programming [can improve your life] from if you are interested in learning programming for the sake of learning, making your job easier, to looking to get a new job all together [extrapolate this a bit more … maybe let's bullet this]

Plus, it has never been easier to learn programming! There are so many more resources other than going through a traditional 4 year computer science program or read a 400 page book.  You can take free online, classes taught by universities like Harvard to classes taught by experts like Peter Norvig (Google..). In addition to online classes,  there are also websites and apps that are build specifically to help you learn programming (which were build by people who knew how to program … meta huh?).

You can take programming to multiples scales from:
1. Learning programming so you can be technologically literate so you can do your job better
2. Learning programming because your love to tinker so you can build apps and Internet of Things that can do … [link some cool IoT things here, such as Nest, Amazon One Click]
3. Learning programming so you can make a career transition and obtain a job as a qualified software engineers, managers, marketers and salespeople in Silicon Valley can rack up dozens of high-paying, high-upside job offers any time they want

> Learning programming is easy now. Something about the wealth of information online and you no longer need to go through a computer science degree or read a 400 page programming book. There are online courses, pod casets, free ebooks, and communnities to help you learn.  

Learning programming can help you build your 
Our world is becoming more and more dependent on technology, and every piece of technology we used is People should familiarize themselves with computers for much the same reason people study shakespeare, because it is an important part of our culture.

On top of that, computer science and software/computer engineering are extremely good careers to get into and both of them require knowledge of programming.

On top of all this, if you enjoy solving puzzles or making things, then programming is a lot of fun

Companies in every industry need to assume that a software revolution is coming. This includes even industries that are software-based today. Great incumbent software companies like Oracle and Microsoft are increasingly threatened with irrelevance by new software offerings like Salesforce.com and Android (especially in a world where Google owns a major handset maker).


Many people in the U.S. and around the world lack the education and skills required to participate in the great new companies coming out of the software revolution. This is a tragedy since every company I work with is absolutely starved for talent. Qualified software engineers, managers, marketers and salespeople in Silicon Valley can rack up dozens of high-paying, high-upside job offers any time they want, while national unemployment and underemployment is sky high. This problem is even worse than it looks because many workers in existing industries will be stranded on the wrong side of software-based disruption and may never be able to work in their fields again. There's no way through this problem other than education, and we have a long way to go.

Many millions of people, and we’ve had students from pretty much every country in the world. Some are looking to become fluent in programming, or understanding what the technology is—we call that technical literacy. Some are looking for a job, and others have a project in mind they’re looking to build. Each of these groups are a separate demographic we try to serve. More than 65 percent of them are not in the U.S. It’s much more diverse than you would expect as compared to a college-level computer science class. In colleges across the U.S., about 18 percent of computer science grads are female; our students are 36 percent female. We’ve been trying to make coding access to everyone, and that is changing the typical profile of the population that’s learning to program.

Programming transforms your computer from a home appliance to a power tool. Whether you have an office job, are a student, or just go online a lot, people use computers to get stuff done. But some tedious, lengthy computer tasks are so specific or context-dependent that no one has produced software to do it. (My next programming book addresses exactly these kinds of problems.) Even without deep programming knowledge, coding becomes a large productivity multiplier. Computers are everywhere; they should be tools, not appliances. A tool is something you sharpen, an appliance is something you replace.

## This Guide ##
> the who
This guide is meant for everyone has little or no background in programming . As long as you have the will and drive, as well as understanding of high school math (like addition, division, algebra, etc.), you can learn and excel at programming.

>the what
This guide is a collection of online resources and books to teach you the basics and foundamental building blocks to programming. All of these resouces listed in this guide are free, and the for pay ones are explicitly marked with a $. 

Once you have a strong grasp of the topics listed in this guide, you should have the foundamental programming skills to learn more challenging tasks and projects like building websites, mobile apps, or programs that can teach itself to recognize cat pictures. 

>the why
There are lots of online resources to learn programming, from online classes provided by Coursera and Udacity to interactive programming platforms like Codeacademy. However, many of these websites don't provide a clear path for students, who don't know where to start like you, to take their first steps on programming. 

There many different options to learn to code online for free. I recommend starting with Codeacademy, joining the GitHub community, regularly reading coding related posts on Hacker News and taking one of the introductory computer science courses from an Ivy League-quality University. You’ll be surprised that coding isn’t nearly as difficult as you think and you can start creating and executing your own programs on your laptop or smartphone in a matter of weeks.

## Why Python ##
> This should be a small section
> Use meta academy's guide on python as an inspiration
There are more languages that are more in the 'mainstream' and accepted.  However, python is a language which provides the most flexibility and heft.

In MY opinion, it is the most versatile, and easiest to learn.  It runs on all platforms, and interacts with just about everything.  However, it is not the flashiest, fastest, or the one with the largest arrays of IDE (interactive development environments).  And it is, arguably, the one with the widest following in college computer science courses.

It is interactive, which means that it is an excellent platform on which to learn and experiment.  But the cost is execution speed.  If you are starting out in computer programming, I believe it is the best choice.  Once you learn python, other languages will come much easier.  If you can play a clarinet, you can play a saxophone.

If you don't have a reason to want to learn a particular language, our recommendation is to start with Python. Here are some of the advantages:
The core language is clean and simple, and presents fewer hurdles to beginners compared with some of the alternatives
It is "batteries included," i.e. a lot of important functionality is included in the standard libraries
It is one of the most popular languages for introductory college courses, so there are lots of materials out there
It is an interpreted language, so you can quickly experiment in an interactive shell
It is a very widely used language, with among the best software platforms for web development, data science, scientific computing, etc.

### FAQ ###

### Advice ###
- If you REALLY want to learn, commit to it. Don't give up, let it take however long it takes, be that months or years, and you will eventually have the skills you desire. At some point you'll want to give up and quit. Its up to you to keep going.
- Learn the details early. If you skip over concepts without fully understanding them, then you will be lost once you learn more advanced things. Learn exactly how it works, or go back and re-learn if necessary.
- When you get stuck on an issue, commit to solving the problem on your own for as long as you can. I've spent hours and hours on the silliest bugs, but every time it lead me to understand programming deeper. If you're still stuck, ask a friend or post on a forum or StackOverflow to resolve your issue. Every bug you fix on your own is a victory, so celebrate them as such.
