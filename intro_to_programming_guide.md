### Advice ###
- If you REALLY want to learn, commit to it. Don't give up, let it take however long it takes, be that months or years, and you will eventually have the skills you desire. At some point you'll want to give up and quit. Its up to you to keep going.
- Learn the details early. If you skip over concepts without fully understanding them, then you will be lost once you learn more advanced things. Learn exactly how it works, or go back and re-learn if necessary.
- When you get stuck on an issue, commit to solving the problem on your own for as long as you can. I've spent hours and hours on the silliest bugs, but every time it lead me to understand programming deeper. If you're still stuck, ask a friend or post on a forum or StackOverflow to resolve your issue. Every bug you fix on your own is a victory, so celebrate them as such.
